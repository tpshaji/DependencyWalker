.TH "CMAKE-INSTRUMENTATION" "7" "Sep 30, 2025" "4.1.2" "CMake"
.SH NAME
cmake-instrumentation \- CMake Instrumentation
.sp
Added in version 4.0.

.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This feature is only available when experimental support for instrumentation
has been enabled by the \fBCMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_INSTRUMENTATION\fP gate.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The CMake Instrumentation API allows for the collection of timing data, target
information and system diagnostic information during the configure, generate,
build, test and install steps for a CMake project.
.sp
This feature is only available for projects using the \fI\%Makefile Generators\fP
or the \fI\%Ninja Generators\fP\&.
.sp
All interactions with the CMake instrumentation API must specify both an API
version and a Data version. At this time, there is only one version for each of
these: the \fI\%API v1\fP and \fI\%Data v1\fP\&.
.SS Data Collection
.sp
Whenever a command is executed with
instrumentation enabled, a \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP is created in the project build
tree with data specific to that command. These files remain until after
\fI\%Indexing\fP occurs.
.sp
CMake sets the \fI\%RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE\fP, \fI\%RULE_LAUNCH_LINK\fP and
\fI\%RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM\fP global properties to use the
\fBctest \-\-instrument\fP launcher in order to capture details of each compile, link
and custom command respectively. If the project has been configured with \fI\%CTestUseLaunchers\fP,
\fBctest \-\-instrument\fP will also include the behavior usually performed by
\fBctest \-\-launch\fP\&.
.SS Indexing
.sp
Indexing is the process of collating generated instrumentation data. Indexing
occurs at specific intervals called hooks, such as after every build. These
hooks are configured as part of the \fI\%v1 Query Files\fP\&. Whenever a hook is
triggered, an index file is generated containing a list of snippet files newer
than the previous indexing.
.sp
Indexing and can also be performed by manually invoking
\fBctest \-\-collect\-instrumentation <build>\fP\&.
.SS Callbacks
.sp
As part of the \fI\%v1 Query Files\fP, users can provide a list of callbacks
intended to handle data collected by this feature.
.sp
Whenever \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs, each provided callback is executed, passing the
path to the generated index file as an argument.
.sp
These callbacks, defined either at the user\-level or project\-level should read
the instrumentation data and perform any desired handling of it. The index file
and its listed snippets are automatically deleted by CMake once all callbacks
have completed. Note that a callback should never move or delete these data
files manually as they may be needed by other callbacks.
.SH ENABLING INSTRUMENTATION
.sp
Instrumentation can be enabled either for an individual CMake project, or
for all CMake projects configured and built by a user. For both cases,
see the \fI\%v1 Query Files\fP for details on configuring this feature.
.SS Enabling Instrumentation at the Project\-Level
.sp
Project code can contain instrumentation queries with the
\fI\%cmake_instrumentation()\fP command.
.sp
In addition, query files can be placed manually under
\fB<build>/.cmake/instrumentation/<version>/query/\fP at the top of a build tree.
This version of CMake supports only one version schema, \fI\%API v1\fP\&.
.SS Enabling Instrumentation at the User\-Level
.sp
Instrumentation can be configured at the user\-level by placing query files in
the \fI\%CMAKE_CONFIG_DIR\fP under
\fB<config_dir>/instrumentation/<version>/query/\fP\&.
.SS Enabling Instrumentation for CDash Submissions
.sp
You can enable instrumentation when using CTest in \fI\%Dashboard Client\fP
mode by setting the \fI\%CTEST_USE_INSTRUMENTATION\fP environment variable
to the current UUID for the \fBCMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_INSTRUMENTATION\fP feature.
Doing so automatically enables the \fBdynamicSystemInformation\fP query.
.sp
The following table shows how each type of instrumented command gets mapped
to a corresponding type of CTest XML file.

.TE
.sp
By default the command line reported to CDash is truncated at the first space.
You can instead choose to report the full command line (including arguments)
by setting \fI\%CTEST_USE_VERBOSE_INSTRUMENTATION\fP to 1.
.SH API V1
.sp
The API version specifies both the subdirectory layout of the instrumentation data,
and the format of the query files.
.sp
The Instrumentation API v1 is housed  in the \fBinstrumentation/v1/\fP directory
under either \fB<build>/.cmake/\fP for output data and project\-level queries, or
\fB<config_dir>/\fP for user\-level queries. The \fBv1\fP component of this
directory is what signifies the API version. It has the following
subdirectories:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBquery/\fP
Holds query files written by users or clients. Any file with the \fB\&.json\fP
file extension will be recognized as a query file. These files are owned by
whichever client or user creates them.
.TP
.B \fBquery/generated/\fP
Holds query files generated by a CMake project with the
\fI\%cmake_instrumentation()\fP command. These files are owned by CMake and
are deleted and regenerated automatically during the CMake configure step.
.TP
.B \fBdata/\fP
Holds instrumentation data collected on the project. CMake owns all data
files, they should never be removed by other processes. Data collected here
remains until after \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs and all \fI\%Callbacks\fP are executed.
.TP
.B \fBcdash/\fP
Holds temporary files used internally to generate XML content to be submitted
to CDash.
.UNINDENT
.SS v1 Query Files
.sp
Any file with the \fB\&.json\fP extension under the \fBinstrumentation/v1/query/\fP
directory is recognized as a query for instrumentation data.
.sp
These files must contain a JSON object with the following keys. The \fBversion\fP
key is required, but all other fields are optional.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBversion\fP
The Data version of snippet file to generate, an integer. Currently the only
supported version is \fB1\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBcallbacks\fP
A list of command\-line strings for \fI\%Callbacks\fP to handle collected
instrumentation data. Whenever these callbacks are executed, the full path to
a \fI\%v1 Index File\fP is appended to the arguments included in the string.
.TP
.B \fBhooks\fP
A list of strings specifying when \fI\%Indexing\fP should occur automatically.
These are the intervals when instrumentation data should be collated and user
\fI\%Callbacks\fP should be invoked to handle the data. Elements in this list
should be one of the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostGenerate\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpreBuild\fP (called when \fBninja\fP  or \fBmake\fP is invoked; unavailable on Windows)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostBuild\fP (called when \fBninja\fP or \fBmake\fP completes; unavailable on Windows)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpreCMakeBuild\fP (called when \fBcmake \-\-build\fP is invoked)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostCMakeBuild\fP (called when \fBcmake \-\-build\fP completes)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostInstall\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostTest\fP
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBqueries\fP
A list of strings specifying additional optional data to collect during
instrumentation. Elements in this list should be one of the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBstaticSystemInformation\fP
Enables collection of the static information about the host machine CMake
is being run from. This data is collected during \fI\%Indexing\fP and is
included in the generated \fI\%v1 Index File\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdynamicSystemInformation\fP
Enables collection of the dynamic information about the host machine
CMake is being run from. Data is collected for every \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP
generated by CMake, and includes information from immediately before and
after the command is executed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBcallbacks\fP listed will be invoked during the specified hooks
\fIat a minimum\fP\&. When there are multiple query files, the \fBcallbacks\fP,
\fBhooks\fP and \fBqueries\fP between them will be merged. Therefore, if any query
file includes any \fBhooks\fP, every \fBcallback\fP across all query files will be
executed at every \fBhook\fP across all query files. Additionally, if any query
file includes any optional \fBqueries\fP, the optional query data will be present
in all data files.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
{
  \(dqversion\(dq: 1,
  \(dqcallbacks\(dq: [
    \(dq/usr/bin/python callback.py\(dq,
    \(dq/usr/bin/cmake \-P callback.cmake arg\(dq,
  ],
  \(dqhooks\(dq: [
    \(dqpostCMakeBuild\(dq,
    \(dqpostInstall\(dq
  ],
  \(dqqueries\(dq: [
    \(dqstaticSystemInformation\(dq,
    \(dqdynamicSystemInformation\(dq
  ]
}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, after every \fBcmake \-\-build\fP or \fBcmake \-\-install\fP
invocation, an index file \fBindex\-<timestamp>.json\fP will be generated in
\fB<build>/.cmake/instrumentation/v1/data\fP containing a list of data snippet
files created since the previous indexing. The commands
\fB/usr/bin/python callback.py index\-<timestamp>.json\fP and
\fB/usr/bin/cmake \-P callback.cmake arg index\-<timestamp>.json\fP will be executed in
that order. The index file will contain the \fBstaticSystemInformation\fP data and
each snippet file listed in the index will contain the
\fBdynamicSystemInformation\fP data. Once both callbacks have completed, the index
file and all snippet files listed by it will be deleted from the project build
tree.
.SH DATA V1
.sp
Data version specifies the contents of the output files generated by the CMake
instrumentation API as part of the \fI\%Data Collection\fP and \fI\%Indexing\fP\&. There are
two types of data files generated: the \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP and \fI\%v1 Index File\fP\&.
When using the \fI\%API v1\fP, these files live in
\fB<build>/.cmake/instrumentation/v1/data/\fP under the project build tree.
.SS v1 Snippet File
.sp
Snippet files are generated for every compile, link and custom command invoked
as part of the CMake build or install step and contain instrumentation data about
the command executed. Additionally, snippet files are created for the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The CMake configure step
.IP \(bu 2
The CMake generate step
.IP \(bu 2
Entire build step (executed with \fBcmake \-\-build\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Entire install step (executed with \fBcmake \-\-install\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Each \fBctest\fP invocation
.IP \(bu 2
Each individual test executed by \fBctest\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These files remain in the build tree until after \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs and any
user\-specified \fI\%Callbacks\fP are executed.
.sp
Snippet files have a filename with the syntax \fB<role>\-<hash>\-<timestamp>.json\fP
and contain the following data:
.INDENT 0.0
